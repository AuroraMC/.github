# Hiya, we're AuroraMC

Welcome to the official AuroraMC GitHub Org! While there is currently nothing here, we will be using this org in the future to host any open-source projects we create!

## Who are we?

We're just a group of gamers with a passion for making great things and making a community people want to be a part of. AuroraMC has been a passion project of ours and has been in development for over 5 years. Our team consists of 3 owners and 3 admins. If you want to find out more about us, feel free to read our "Meet the Team" thread [here](https://auroramc.net/meet-the-team/)!

## Why us?

We pride ourselves on our commitment to creaing community focused content. We put the community at the heart of what we do, from the updates we create to the policies we put in place. Our community is everything. If you have a suggestion, don't hessitate to submit an idea suggestion [here](https://auroramc.net/threads/posting-an-idea-to-the-forums.114/) or if you spot something that doesn't look quite right, submit a bug report [here](https://auroramc.net/bug-report/). We consider every idea proposed to us, and we follow a publicly published process to decide whether to go forward with an idea. You can find that process [here](https://auroramc.net/threads/posting-an-idea-to-the-forums.114/). We act quickly to fix bugs that are forwarded to us, particularly if a game or features is not usable as a result.
